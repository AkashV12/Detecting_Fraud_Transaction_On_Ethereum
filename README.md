# Detecting_Fraud_Transaction_On_Ethereum

# Situation:
 Why I choose this project? Here is the answer So we know Dubai became the world's first government to turn 100% paperless in 2021, the announcement was made by the United Arab Emirate (UAE). It will save around 3 billion Dirham (USD 350 million) and 14-million-man hours. In recent time crypto is the trending topic.Everyone knows that what is crypto.This project is all about the crypto transaction. In recent times all the banks have their own fraud analyst Because whenever our technology is updated there is disadvantages also there. which means fraud transaction also increased day by day. So we always ready to take action or protected our datas.

# Objectives:
The objective of this Projects is to find the patterns of transactions performed and help algorithms learn those patterns in identifying the fradulent transactions and flag them.

# Approach and Uses of this project:
By using this project, We find the transaction which is fraud or non fraud. In future world we know that all the transaction may be in crypto . In UK and US almost most of the shops accept the crypto. So In future oviously  this project helpful for many companies.By using all the preprocessing steps our data is ready for models. I'll do more than 8 model to predict this data and comparing the models based on the accuracy and for model performance based on the F1-Score.

# Result:
By looking all the models in our project most of the models gives us the best accuracy and f1 score like its almost gives 90% accuracy and F1 score.By looking this kind of model performance which means our preprocessing steps helps to increase the model performance. So we said that it gonna be predict the future data approximatley good only. which means if any new data and future data comes to our model we said that its Our model predict approximately.

Thank You.....
